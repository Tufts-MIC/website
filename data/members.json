      "bio": "My aunt introduced me to the words robot and artificial intelligence when I was seven. Ever since then, I've dreamt of a comic book-inspired future with super-intelligent machines. When I came to Boston University, I really wanted to study AI, but the classes never aligned with my schedule. I graduated undergrad without every taking any class in AI. What I see in the Machine Intelligence Community is an opportunity for anyone to get into artificial intelligence, learn without the penalty of failure and without the stress of deadlines, meet like-minded people, and foster intellectual curiosity.",
